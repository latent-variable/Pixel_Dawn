\section{Story Line, Objective, and Tools}

An outbreak has occurred and 99\%\ of all living beings have turned into zombies. The player can choose from 4 different characters, each with their own back story (explained in section two). The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible, while killing as many zombies as possible. This game will be in 2D and will have aspects of run and gun, survival, and platforming. It will be a humorous, arcade-style game, and the story will be very minimal and not very impactful on the gameplay.
\\\\
The objective for the player is to survive as many waves of zombies as possible. In order to kill zombies the player will have weapons such as many different types of guns and throwable weapons like grenades. After each wave the amount of zombies that spawn will increase making each wave more difficult to pass.

We will use Unity as our game engine, and Gimp for creating our art.

\section{Character Back-stories}
There will be multiple characters that the player can choose from, each with their own unique abilities and back-story.

%\subsection{Ninja}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Ninja: Her father trained her with a katana, but then the zombies killed her father, so now she seeks revenge with fatherâ€™s sword. 
%\subsection{Cyborg}

\item Cyborg: A failed military prototype for being too violent and was going to be destroyed, but escaped during the outbreak. He now kills the zombies for pleasure.
    
%\subsection{Little Girl}

\item Little Girl: A sadistic little girl who found her place in the apocalypse. She has a husky with a turret the follows here every where. 
    
%\subsection{Solider}

\item Soldier: He is a generic, patriotic soldier.
    
%\subsection{Zombies}

\item Zombies: These are the enemies. There are four types: Humans, bears, wolves, vultures.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Character Actions and Abilities}

All playable characters will be able to run and jump using WASD and Space. The player will use the mouse to aim their weapons and attack. However, each character will have their own special abilities, both passive and activatable.

\begin{enumerate}
    
%\subsection{Ninja}

\item Ninja: She will be able to double jump and jump off walls. This character will be the most mobile of the four classes, but has little to few offensive abilities, including dashes and sword strikes.

%\subsection{Cyborg}

\item Cyborg: He will be able to fly for short periods of time. This character will deal more damage while in the air, due to having activatable abilities only available while airborne.
    
%\subsection{Little Girl}

\item Little Girl: She moves slow, but her dog that follows her around can equip a weapon as well. She has spikes in power when she has a tantrum. Her activatable abilities will involve her dog and her screams.
    
%\subsection{Solider}

\item Soldier: He is able to run quickly on the ground and attacks with his weapons at a faster rate. He is the most "basic" of the characters, having very similar mechanics to soldier characters in other games. His activatable abilities include air strikes and explosives.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Art}
    The game will be made in pixel art, some of the assets will be obtained from free to uses assets online, and other more specific assets will need to be made.  The art for the character will required to have a separate sprite from the body and the arms so the that arms can hold weapons and aim all around them. The art for the world will be determined by the assets that are available to us. 


\section{Character Interactions}
Characters have lives that will decrease when hit, and the game is over when you have 0 lives. The game is only single player.
